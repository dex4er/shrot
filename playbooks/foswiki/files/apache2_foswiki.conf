# Autogenerated httpd.conf file for Foswiki.
# Generated at http://foswiki.org/Support/ApacheConfigGenerator

# We set an environment variable called blockAccess.
#
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents Foswiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other Foswikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
#
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a foswiki
#
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker blockAccess
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ blockAccess

#support the cgi-bin url's
RedirectMatch ^/cgi-bin/foswiki/(.*)$ /foswiki/bin/$1

RedirectMatch ^/foswiki/?$ /foswiki/bin/view$1
RedirectMatch ^/foswiki(/([A-Z].*)?)?$ /foswiki/bin/view$1

#see /etc/foswiki/ShorterUrl.conf to activate ShorterUrls

# The ScriptAlias defines the bin directory as a directory where CGI
# scripts are allowed.
# The first parameter will be part of the URL to your installation e.g.
# http://my.co.uk/foswiki/bin/view/...
# The second parameter must point to the physical path on your disc.
ScriptAlias /foswiki/bin "/home/foswiki/bin"

# The Alias defines a url that points to the root of the foswiki installation.
# It is used to access files in the pub directory (attachments etc)
# It must come _after_ the ScriptAlias.
