### END INIT INFO
#
# This file is part of the resolvconf package.
#
# We really need "X-Stop-Before: networking ifupdown" too because
# terminal ifdowns shouldn't update resolv.conf;
# however there is unfortunately no such thing as "X-Stop-Before".
#
# This file is not used in Ubuntu.
#

# Don't use set -e; check return status instead.
